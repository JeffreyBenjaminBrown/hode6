# OBSOLETE, why it is

There are no ideas in this that can't be gleaned from
the more interesting hidden text demo at `src/demo/invis/`.

## BROKEN LINKS

Since I moved this code here from a deeper folder,
any relative links in it are broken.

# Purpose

The code in this folder demosntrates how to:

* keep a model of a file in Python
* manipulate the model by sending commands to Python via Emacs
* view the results of those manipulations in an Emacs buffer
