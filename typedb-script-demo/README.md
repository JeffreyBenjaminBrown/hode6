The two .tql files here are scheme and data files downloaded from Vaticle's TypeDB tutorials:
  https://typedb.com/docs/manual/console#_non_interactive_mode

The two .txt files are scripts, runnable like so:
```
typedb console --script=path_to_script.txt
# or
typedb console --script=path_to_script.txt > output.txt
```

The more interesting one is `make-and-query-the-iam-db.txt`,
which, to a certain resolution,
does all the things I need to do in TypeDB.
