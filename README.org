* the presentable, friendly parts of this code
  Every top-level entity in `src/demo/`
  is user- and reader-friendly code.
  If it's a folder, it contains a helpful README.

  The top-level code in `src/` outside of `src/demo/`
  might make sense to nobody but myself so far.
* how to launch the unfriendly top-level code
  serial
** First, get the latest Docker image:
  `docker pull jeffreybbrown/hode:latest`.
  (Alternatively, build it yourself -- see `docker/` --
  and either give it that name, or edit all instances
  of that name in th e code to be what you called it.
  `docker/commands.sh` has some commands I find handy for that.)
** Evaluate `src/hode.el`.
   Visit it and run `M-x eval-buffer`.
** M-x hode-start
