* integrate Emacs & Python
** The Python carries a state of the view -- a string.
** The Emacs displays a document.
   The user can write into it.
*** Optional: The user can't save it.
    It's misleading if they can,
    as that will not have any effect once I'm using TypeDB.
** The Emacs sends a command to the Python.
   There should be only one Emacs command,
   which prompts the user for a Python-parseable string.
** The Python parses the command.
   Two commands: Append a number to the document,
   or delete <number> lines.
** The Python overwrites the file.
** The Emacs redisplays that (automatically).
* keep a config folder
  Both Python and Emacs will eventually need to read it.
