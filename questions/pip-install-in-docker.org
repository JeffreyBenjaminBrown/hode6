pip install fails in docker build but succeeds interactively in Docker container

I built a Docker image. If I run (as root) the image in a container, I can execute the following from Bash:
```
cd /root
python3 -m venv .venv
source          .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r ./requirements-for-pip.txt
```

I am able to load the libraries listed in the requirements file from the Python REPL, so I know it works.

But if I try to add a passage like this to the end of the Dockerfile that I'm using to build the container:

```
WORKDIR /root
RUN python3 -m venv .venv                      && \
    source          .venv/bin/activate         && \
    pip3 install -r ./requirements-for-pip.txt && \
```

the build fails with an error like this:
```
ERROR: failed to solve: process
  "/bin/sh -c python3 -m venv .venv
&& source .venv/bin/activate && pip3 install -r ./requirements-for-pip.txt"
did not complete successfully: exit code: 127
```

(I've added newlines and deleted whitespace for readability.)

I've tried omitting the WORKDIR directive and instead starting the RUN command with "cd /root". I've tried ending the passage with "deactivate". I always get the same error.

I've tried running each line separately, and the one where the Docker file chokes is this one:
